# Photoweb

It is a photography website. I utilised the following technologies for this assessment: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, and MySql. We have mostly concentrated on developing a Login and Logout flow that is related to a database, and we have also received requests for pictures.

## Screenshots

This page serves as the site's index and includes a contact form and the admin login.

We can see in the admin login that the admin may login using the user id and password to retrieve the information of the login credentials. If the user ID and password are accurate, then it will successful login; otherwise, the opposite will be true.

The admin can log out after retrieving the data from the MySQL database by clicking the signout button, which will take them back to the index page.

Customers may contact the photographer using this website by choosing the date of their event from the calendar, their email address, and any further notes they would want to include.
